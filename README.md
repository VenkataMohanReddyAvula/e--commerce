# Product Landing Page

This project is a modern, responsive product landing page built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It presents a range of products in a clean and organized layout and provides users with interactive features such as buying simulations, searching, and navigation. The design is visually appealing and structured to deliver a smooth user experience across all devices.

## Introduction

The Product Landing Page project is designed to mimic the essential features of a basic online shopping website. It features various product cards, each containing an image, description, price, rating, and an interactive "Buy Now" button. The project is entirely frontend-based and is perfect for showcasing frontend development capabilities.

This page demonstrates how common e-commerce functionalities can be simulated using vanilla JavaScript without any backend integration. Elements like the search bar, product selection, user alerts, hover animations, and social interactions all work together to create a dynamic and engaging user interface. This is a great project for beginners looking to strengthen their skills in layout design, responsive UI, and DOM manipulation.
